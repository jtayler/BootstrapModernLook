By providing titles or keypath selector strings in the form of a dictionary, where keys are named after their css controll counterparts found in Bootsrap and Shards.

<code>
      entity.name = 'Post' => cardSectionsContents = {
            "card-img-top" = "object.imageURL"; 
            "card-link" = "object.publicURLString"; 
            "card-text" = "object.title"; 
            "card-title" = "object.venue.title"; 
            "cardLInkTitle" = "Tell me more &rarr;"; 
      }
</code>

      
Keypath selector keys controlling Bootsrap elements return values based on the current object and context. Other Keypath selector keys return normal text/html string details, such as cardLInkTitle

<code>
      "cardLInkTitle" = "Tell me more &rarr;"; 
</code>


Each component has extends this metaphore so a single rule can control an arbitrarilty complex UI copmonent.

A simple D2W Rule to set "repetitionComonentName" to either "BMLCardRepetition" or "BMLCarouselRepetition" and turn any list into a complex card or carousel. Empty list messages and batching controls are maintained and styled.

<code>
      60 : (pageConfiguration = 'ListPost-Author' or pageConfiguration = 'ListBookmark-Author') => repetitionComponentName = BMLCardRepetition
</code>
